				Last Update: <strong>20th June, 2013</strong> — <i>I got prodded into updating this and making it a bit more SEO friendly. Figured I'd take the opportunity to give it a non-terrible design and expand the scope a little to cover all efforts to implement web components, not just Chrome's.</i>
			</p>

			<h2 id="wtf">Web Components!?</h2>

			<p>What are web components? They are encapsulated, reusable and composable widgets for the web platform. If that sounds cool, then I urge you to check out one of the <a href="http://youtu.be/fqULJBBEVQE">very good introductions</a> to them that others have provided. In my opinion, they're the most exciting thing to happen in web development since HTML5. Why? Because they promise to put the power and extensibility necessary to build sophisticated widgets and applications right into core web feature set. Imagine the capabilities of libraries like Angular, Ember, and Backbone, but as a foundation of the platform, standardised across all browsers.

			<p>The purpose of this page is to track progress across the various documents where web components are being specified, the polyfills that let you use them today, and their implementation in browsers that will make them a first class citizen of the web in the months and years to come.</p>

			<h2>Specs!</h2>

			<p>Web components are being specified at the W3C, with Dimtri Glazkov leading the charge, ably assisted by various other heroes. Spec documents have a reputation in some quarters as being dense and unreadable, which is perhaps partly deserved. They do contain a lot of details that only browser engineers really need to worry about. But, modern specs also often contain very readable explainers and examples, and they're usually the most accurate and detailed source of information on how things really work.</p>

			<ul class="specs">

				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="polyfills">Polyfills!</h2>

			<p>There are two polyfills of web components available. The first is <a href="http://www.x-tags.org/">X-Tags by Mozilla</a>, and the second is <a href="http://polymer-project.org">Polymer by Google</a>. Both are slightly different, and my impression is that Polymer is somewhat more expansive in the scope of the APIs it implements. Go nuts, try both!</p>

			<h2 id="code">Code!</h2>

			<p>Implementation of web components within browsers has begun, although the split of Blink from WebKit has muddied the waters slightly. This appears to be the status at present:</p>

			<ul class="browsers">
				<li class="chrome">
					<p>
						Chrome is the gold standard. Google has been leading to effort to spec and implement web components, and two of its features, shadow DOM and templates, are already shipping in Chrome's stable channel, while development is fast progressing on others.
					</p>
					<p>
						The shift from WebKit's bugzilla to the Chromium tracker has made it a little more difficult to follow the implementation effort, as there aren't the meta bugs and trees I used to use to follow everything, but most of the relevant issues are linked in the table above.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li class="firefox">
					<p>
						Mozilla haven't been slouching either, and have made good progress towards implementing various parts of web components in Firefox. They have <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=811542">a tracking bug here</a>, and various features are being implemented via its dependencies.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li class="safari">
					<p>
						Although a number of web components features were implemented by Google within the WebKit codebase, they were never switched on in Safari. With the departure of the Chromium port, the WebKit maintainers have begun to remove features <a href="https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2013-May/024894.html">such as shadow DOM</a> from the codebase. This is understandable from an engineering perspective, as unused code shouldn't be left lying around, but as a web developer it's disappointing to see.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li class="ie">
					<p>
						Microsoft don't talk about their development plans publicly, so it's not clear if and when they will implement web components features, but there are positive signs: They co-edit the HTML Templates spec, and they have history providing an analogous feature in IE's old element behaviours<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. Given their generally conservative approach nowadays, I think it's unlikely we'll see anything in IE11, but never say never.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li class="opera">
					<p>
						As Opera have switched to base their browsers on Chromium/Blink, I expect they will broadly follow Chrome in terms of implementation status.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Who made this?</h2>

			<p>I'm Jon Rimmer, a web developer who spends way too much of his free time reading blogs, W3C mailing lists and teleconference minutes to find out what's happening with the web platform. I don't work for a browser vendor or standards group, but I've been a fan of the web components technology since I first heard of it, and this is my way of helping me and others keep track of its development. <a href="http://blog.brillskills.com">I have a blog</a>, where I ramble unceasingly.</p>

			<p>If you spot anything that's inaccurate, outdated, or could just be improved, please let me know <a href="https://github.com/JonRimmer/Are-We-Componentized-Yet">via GitHub</a>.</p>
